# Contributing to @Pexelize/pexelize-editor-angular

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 16
- npm >= 8

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pexelize/pexelize-editor-angular.git
cd pexelize-angular
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the package:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development

### Project Structure

```
pexelize-angular/
  src/
    index.ts                        # Package entry point (re-exports)
    pexelize-editor.component.ts    # Core editor component
    pexelize-editor.module.ts       # NgModule wrapper
  dist/                             # Build output (ESM + types)
  demo/                             # Working demo app (Angular 17)
  rollup.config.js                  # Rollup build configuration
  tsconfig.json                     # TypeScript configuration
```

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile with ngc and bundle with Rollup |
| `npm run dev` | Build in watch mode for development |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run lint` | Lint source files with ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run tests with Jest |
| `npm run clean` | Remove the `dist/` directory |

### Running the Demo

The `demo/` directory contains a standalone Angular 17 app that imports the local package via `file:..`. Use it to test your changes:

```bash
# Build the package first
npm run build

# Then run the demo
cd demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo starts at [http://localhost:4014](http://localhost:4014).

For a faster feedback loop, run the library in watch mode in one terminal and the demo dev server in another:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — rebuild on source changes
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — demo dev server
cd demo && npm run dev
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

2. Make your changes in the `src/` directory. The main component logic is in `src/pexelize-editor.component.ts`.

3. Verify your changes:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

4. Test with the demo app to confirm the editor works correctly.

5. Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for custom toolbar configuration"
```

### Commit Message Convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `refactor:` — code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks (deps, CI, build config)

## Pull Requests

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a pull request against the `main` branch.
3. Provide a clear description of what your changes do and why.
4. Make sure the CI checks pass (typecheck, lint, build).

## Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Pexelize/pexelize-editor-angular/issues) to report bugs or request features.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue, expected vs. actual behavior, and your environment details (Node version, browser, OS).

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled.
- Follow the existing code patterns in `src/pexelize-editor.component.ts`.
- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs.
